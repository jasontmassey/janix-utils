# PURPOSE
#
# `pt' is a "probability tester" which enables you to run a specific
# command on a random basis. For example, if you want want a command to
# execute 7 times out of 11 then you issue as follows:
#
#   pt 11 7 && /path/to/your/command [args...]
#
#
# EXAMPLES
#
# You wish to have a command run at midnight, on average, seven days out of
# every thirty days; place this entry into your crontab:
#
#   0 0 * * * pt 30 7 && /path/to/your/command [args...]
#
#
# You wish to have a command run randomly five times every hour; place this
# entry into your crontab
#
#   * * * * * pt 60 5 && /path/to/your/command [args...]
#
#
# A NOTE ON PROBABILITY
#
# It is important for you to realize that `pt 30 7' will randomly cause
# an event to run, ON AVERAGE, seven out of thirty times -- not EXACTLY
# seven out of thirty times. So, your `pt 30 7' command, should you run it
# ten thousand times, would return `0' (i.e., cause your command to run)
# approximately 2,333 times, but not exactly. Classical probability must
# be viewed as a "long term average."
#
#
# SYNTAX
#
# pt denominator [numerator]
#
# If the numerator is omitted then it defaults to 1. The probability of `pt'
# returning `0' (success) is given by proper fraction numeration/denominator.
#
#
# RETURNS
#
#   0 if the random event happens
#   1 otherwise
