NAME
     jxpt - Janix Probability Tester

SYNOPSIS
     jxpt denominator [numerator] && /path/to/a/command [args...]

DESCRIPTION
     jxpt accepts a probability as an argument (as denoted by the quotient:
     numerator divided by denominator) then randomly generates an event.  If
     that event corresponds to the probability, then jxpt exits successfully;
     otherwise, jxpt exits unsuccessfully.  If the optional numerator is
     omitted from the command-line then it takes on a default value of `1'.

   The Spirit of the Utility
     jxpt is intended for situations when you want to invoke a command on the
     basis of some probability.  For example, imagine a job you want scheduled
     to run, on average, once every seven days at midnight.  The following
     crontab entry accomplishes the goal:

	   0 0 * * * jxpt 7 1 && /path/to/a/command

     Note that the crontab entry executes every day; however, jxpt will only
     exit successfully, on average, one out of every seven executions.	The
     bash shell's `&&' control operator invokes `/path/to/a/command' only if
     jxpt exits successfully.

   A NOTE ON PROBABILITY
     Classical probability must be viewed as a long term average.  It is
     important to realize that, for example, jxpt 30 7 causes an event to run,
     on average, seven out of thirty times -- not exactly seven out of thirty
     times.  So, a jxpt 30 7 command, should you run it ten thousand times,
     would exit successfully approximately 2,333 times, but not exactly.

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
     jxpt uses the bash shell language exclusively.

RETURN VALUES
     jxpt returns 0 (successful) if the event it randomly produces matches the
     supplied probability, else jxpt returns 1 (unsuccessful).

ENVIRONMENT
     jxpt neither reads nor writes environment variables.

FILES
     jxpt neither reads nor writes disk files.

HISTORY
     The author needed a utility to randomly schedule the emailing of quotes
     and reminders.
