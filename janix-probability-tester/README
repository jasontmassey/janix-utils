     jjxxpptt accepts a probability as an argument (as denoted by the quotient:
     _n_u_m_e_r_a_t_o_r divided by _d_e_n_o_m_i_n_a_t_o_r) then randomly generates an event.  If
     that event corresponds to the probability, then jjxxpptt exits successfully;
     otherwise, jjxxpptt exits unsuccessfully.  If the optional _n_u_m_e_r_a_t_o_r is
     omitted from the command-line then it takes on a default value of `1'.

     jjxxpptt is intended for situations when you want to invoke a command on the
     basis of some probability.  For example, imagine a job you want scheduled
     to run, _o_n _a_v_e_r_a_g_e, once every seven days at midnight.  The following
     crontab entry accomplishes the goal:

           0 0 * * * jxpt 7 1 && /path/to/a/command

     Note that the crontab entry executes _e_v_e_r_y _d_a_y; however, jjxxpptt will only
     exit successfully, _o_n _a_v_e_r_a_g_e, one out of every seven executions.  The
     bash shell's `&&' control operator invokes `/path/to/a/command' only if
     jjxxpptt exits successfully.

     Classical probability must be viewed as a long term average.  It is
     important to realize that, for example, jjxxpptt 30 7 causes an event to run,
     _o_n _a_v_e_r_a_g_e, seven out of thirty times -- not _e_x_a_c_t_l_y seven out of thirty
     times.  So, a jjxxpptt 30 7 command, should you run it ten thousand times,
     would exit successfully _a_p_p_r_o_x_i_m_a_t_e_l_y 2,333 times, but not exactly.

     jjxxpptt returns 0 (successful) if the event it randomly produces matches the
     supplied probability, else jjxxpptt returns 1 (unsuccessful).

     jjxxpptt neither reads nor writes environment variables.
