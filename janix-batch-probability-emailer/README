jxptbatch-emailer "Janix Batch Probability Emailer"

In short, jxptbatch-emailer sends an individual email for each line of standard
output produced by jxptbatch.

The program changes into the indicated working-path (which is presumably
configured for the jxptbatch utility), invokes jxptbatch, then for each line
written to standard output, creates an email with the indicated subject to
each indicated addressee.

In essence, this makes jxptbatch-email a wrapper for jxptbatch.
