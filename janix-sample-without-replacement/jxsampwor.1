.Sh DESCRIPTION
You can understand
.Qq sample without replacement
using the example of drawing winning numbers for a lottery.
Imagine a box filled with ten ping-pong balls,
each labeled with a unique number from 1 to 10.
You begin by shaking up the box then drawing the first winning number
.Pq say, Ql 3 .
That act of extracting one of the balls from the population of balls is known as
.Qq sampling .
As you reach to draw out the second winning number, notice that you did not put
the first ball back;
that is, you sampled the first ball without replacing it.
(Contrast this to rolling a die: each toss constitutes a sample
.Em with
replacement.
The value just rolled/sampled continues being a possible sample in subsequent
tosses.  Said another way: with every toss you are drawing from the entire
population.) You draw out the second winning number, then the third, and so
forth, until you are satisfied or until the population of balls is exhausted.
.Pp
More generally, to
.Qq sample without replacement
means to randomly select one element from a population of N elements, to
process said element, then to be left with the remaining N-1 non-selected
elements. Iterate until satisfied or until all the original N elements are
consumed.
(With this version of
.Nm ,
on iteration N+1, the entire population of N elements is replaced, and sampling
resumes with all N to choose from.
In a future version, option
.Fl N
will be introduced to control this behavior.)
.Pp
.Nm
performs sampling without replacement of the elements supplied on the
command-line.
To take multiple samples, invoke
.Nm
repeatedly with the exact same syntax (see
.Sx EXAMPLES
below).
.Ss Command-line Options and Arguments
Invoke
.Nm
alone or with the
.Fl h
option to display a brief help page (to standard error) then to exit (successfully).
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width XXXX
.It Fl d
Print debugging information to standard error.
.It Fl f
Treat each element as a file rather than a literal element.
The concatenation of all such files constitutes the population from which
samples are drawn.
.It Fl s Ar /path/to/samples
Store sampled elements into the file
.Ar /path/to/samples
rather than into the default
.Pa jxsampwor.samples
in the current working directory.
.El
.Sh IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
.Nm
is implemented using the Bourne Again Shell (bash) and GNU Core Utilities
(coreutils).
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Nm
exits unsuccessfully
.Pq Ql 1
if it cannot locate dependent utilities (e.g., GNU shuf).
Otherwise, it exits successfully
.Pq Ql 0
if a sample is able to be printed to standard
output.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Nm
does not read or write any environment variables.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width "Pa /path/to/samples"
.It Pa jxsampwor.samples
The default file into which samples drawn are recorded;
placed into the current working directory.
.It Pa /path/to/samples
Established via the
.Fl s
option.
Overrides the default
.Pa jxsampwor.samples .
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
Sample from ping-pong balls numbered 1-10:
.Pp
.Dl $ jxsampwor 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
.Pp
Sample from ping-pong balls numbered 1-10 using a bash sequence expression:
.Pp
.Dl $ jxsampwor {1..10}
.Pp
Reset the samples history (assuming you are not using
.Fl s
to specify a custom samples history):
.Pp
.Dl $ rm jxsampwor.samples
.Pp
Draw samples from elements contained in a single file (one per line):
.Pp
.Dl $ jxsampwor -f myfile
.Pp
Draw samples from elements contained in multiple files
(NOTE: the population is constituted from the concatenation of all files):
.Pp
.Dl $ jxsampwor -f myfile myfile2 myfile3
.Sh FORTHCOMING FEATURES
The following options are envisioned
.Bl -tag -width XXXX
.It Fl N
Do not replace the entire population of N elements after N successive samples;
on the (N+1)th iteration, nothing is printed to standard output.
(Contrast this to the default behavior which is to replace all
N elements of the population after they have been exhausted (which seems
contradictory given
.Nm
is to sample without replacement).)
.It Fl r
Reset the samples history. (Presently, to reset the samples history, it is
necessary to manually delete either
.Pa jxsampwor.samples
from the current working directory, or
.Pa /path/to/samples
specified by the
.Fl s
option.)
